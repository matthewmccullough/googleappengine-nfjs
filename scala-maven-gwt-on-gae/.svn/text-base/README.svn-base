scala-gwt-dlx is a demo application that solves Sudoku puzzles, using a Sudoku
solver written in Scala. The servlet component, SudokuApiImpl, is also written
in Scala, providing an example of how use GWT RPC from Scala. The sovler makes
use of Donald Knuth's "Dancing Links" algorithm.

It works on App Engine; you can see a live version on appspot at:
http://gwtdlx.appspot.com.

Interesting things about this demo:
- running Scala on App Engine
- GWT RPC: seamless call from client-side GWT to server-side Scala
- landing page is done with JSP

The Eclipse .project file was made with Eclipse 3.4 JDT, and expects the Google
Plugin for Eclipse and the Scala Eclipse IDE.

The unit tests use ScalaTest, which is provided to us under the Apache 2.0
