Generate XML files required by App Engine for JRuby from a rackup file.
This works from standard Ruby or JRuby, but you'll need the rack gem.         

Configure your app from within the 'config.ru' file:

  AppEngine::Rack.app.configure( :application => 'simple', :version => 2 )

Now run xmlgen.rb and and your ready to go:

  jruby -rubygems -e 'require "appengine-tools/genxml"'
